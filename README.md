=======
ses_cap_lite module can be installed and run stand-alone; CAP profiles can be written to any content type as defined 
in the ses_cap_lite configuration 

ses_custom includes customizations strictly for School of Earth Sciences (though adaptable to anyone) and uses the 
Workgroup API (someone should write a module wrapper around that) and WMD4 (my version of webauth that uses the
Webauth Optional directive. ses_custom implements hooks defined by ses_cap_lite to keep user accounts in synch with
profiles. This version has *not* been fully debugged...

Please enjoy.
